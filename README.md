=======

A simple app to help with the day to day Websphere admin tasks we need to do in our local development environments. The initial version will provide a simple mechanism to allow url and datasource configurations to be easily installed, deleted and replaced either individually or in bulk.

Mostly the app is a opportunity to build something that uses a number of the technologies out there today that are interesting to me whilst also providing a tool that will be useful in our day to day jobs.

- Angular JS
- Yeoman
- Zurb Foundation
- Grails

As the project evolves the README and wiki will evolve to detail the architecture and features implemented.
